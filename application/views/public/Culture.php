The city is situated on the banks of the Godavari River, making it one of the holiest places for Hindus all over the world.</p>
					<p class="iner mt-4" style="font-size: 15px;">Nashik has a rich historical past, as the mythology has it that Lord Rama, the King of Ayodhya, made Nashik his abode during his 14 years in exile. At the same place Lord Laxman, by the wish of Lord Rama, cut the nose of “Shurpnakha” and thus this city was named as “Nashik”. </p>
